# AGENTS.md

## Project Shape
- This is a small static browser game, not a packaged app: no `package.json`, lockfile, bundler, or build step is present.
- The current product identity is `GLITCH DUEL`; avoid reintroducing previous branding in active UI or docs.
- Main entrypoint is `src/index.html`; open or serve that path, not the old deleted `stick_game.html`.
- Code is split across `src/index.html`, `src/styles.css`, `src/i18n.js`, `src/config.js`, `src/audio.js`, `src/effects.js`, `src/ai.js`, `src/fighter_render.js`, `src/fighter.js`, and `src/game.js`; keep new gameplay logic in the closest existing file.
- Unit tests live in `tests/game.test.js` and use Node's built-in `node:test` with DOM/canvas/audio mocks; no npm install is needed.

## Run And Verify
- Quick local run: open `C:\tmp\game\src\index.html` in a browser.
- Preferred local run from `C:\tmp\game`: `python -m http.server 8000`, then browse to `http://localhost:8000/src/`.
- Node alternative from `C:\tmp\game`: `npx http-server . -p 8000`, then browse to `http://localhost:8000/src/`.
- GitHub Pages deploy uses `.github/workflows/pages.yml` and publishes `src/` as the site root via GitHub Actions; keep this no-build workflow unless the project architecture changes.
- JS syntax check: run `node --check` for each `src\*.js` file.
- Unit tests: `node --test tests\game.test.js`.
- Manual smoke test: menu appears with balanced text layout, language selector switches Spanish/English and persists, `Tab` shows visible focus, difficulty selector changes CPU behavior, arena selector changes background, `Reducir movimiento` persists and reduces impact shake, `AYUDA`/`HELP` opens help, `VOLVER`/`BACK` returns, `INICIAR JUEGO`/`START GAME` starts, `A/D/W/S/I/J/K/L` work, arrow keys move/jump/crouch, `C` crouches, `S` and `I` block, combos `J,J`, `J,K`, and `K,K` work and show distinct visual feedback, `P`/`Esc` pause and resume with round/score/time/difficulty/arena summary, timer counts down in real seconds during play, health bars animate after damage, stats update after game over, portrait phone shows orientation warning, canvas stays proportional after resize, game over appears at `0%`, `REINICIAR`/`RESTART` restarts, `MENU` returns to menu.

## Runtime Notes
- `gameState` in `src/game.js` controls simulation: `menu`, `paused`, `roundOver`, and `gameOver` stop updates; only `playing` advances physics, AI, and combat.
- Round timer uses delta time from `requestAnimationFrame(timestamp)`; cooldowns, combo windows, hit-stun, hit-stop, and visual timers remain frame-based.
- Mobile controls and the pause button are hidden outside `playing`; call `updateControlsVisibility()` when changing state.
- Web Audio is created lazily after user interaction via `initAudio()` to satisfy browser autoplay policies.
- Canvas simulation uses fixed logical dimensions `1000x500`; `resizeCanvas()` maps that space to a responsive CSS size and DPR-aware backing store. Keep hitboxes in logical coordinates.

## Conventions
- Preserve the current no-dependency setup: use browser/Node native APIs only, unless an explicit architecture decision justifies external libraries.
- If proposing an external dependency, document why it is needed and how it changes local run/test commands before adding it.
- Keep Spanish as the default/fallback UI language; English strings live in `src/i18n.js`.
- Update `Readme.md` when changing run instructions, controls, game states, or implemented backlog items.

## ExecPlans
- Follow `PLANS.md` for any substantial implementation plan.
- Store plans in `plans/` using `plans/plan_<nnnn>_<objetivo>.md`, with zero-padded incremental numbers.
- Validate proposed ExecPlans with the `karpathy-guidelines` skill before finalizing them.
- Keep plans current when scope, validation, or implementation details change.
