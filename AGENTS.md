## Project Shape
- This is a small static browser game, not a packaged app: no `package.json`, lockfile, bundler, or build step is present.
- Main entrypoint is `src/index.html`; open or serve that path, not the old deleted `stick_game.html`.
- Code is split across `src/index.html`, `src/styles.css`, and `src/game.js`; keep changes in those files unless adding a real new concern.
- Unit tests live in `tests/game.test.js` and use Node's built-in `node:test` with DOM/canvas/audio mocks; no npm install is needed.

## Run And Verify
- Quick local run: open `C:\tmp\game\src\index.html` in a browser.
- Preferred local run from `C:\tmp\game`: `python -m http.server 8000`, then browse to `http://localhost:8000/src/`.
- Node alternative from `C:\tmp\game`: `npx http-server . -p 8000`, then browse to `http://localhost:8000/src/`.
- JS syntax check: `node --check src\game.js`.
- Unit tests: `node --test tests\game.test.js`.
- Manual smoke test: menu appears, `AYUDA` opens help, `VOLVER` returns, `INICIAR JUEGO` starts, `A/D/W/S/J/K` work, `P`/`Esc` pause and resume, canvas stays proportional after resize, game over appears at `0%`, `REINICIAR` restarts, `MENU` returns to menu.

## Runtime Notes
- `gameState` in `src/game.js` controls simulation: `menu`, `paused`, and `gameOver` stop updates; only `playing` advances physics, AI, and combat.
- Mobile controls and the pause button are hidden outside `playing`; call `updateControlsVisibility()` when changing state.
- Web Audio is created lazily after user interaction via `initAudio()` to satisfy browser autoplay policies.
- Canvas simulation uses fixed logical dimensions `1000x500`; `resizeCanvas()` maps that space to a responsive CSS size and DPR-aware backing store. Keep hitboxes in logical coordinates.

## Conventions
- Preserve the current no-dependency setup: use browser/Node native APIs only, unless an explicit architecture decision justifies external libraries.
- If proposing an external dependency, document why it is needed and how it changes local run/test commands before adding it.
- Keep UI text Spanish unless the user asks otherwise.
- Update `Readme.md` when changing run instructions, controls, game states, or implemented backlog items.
