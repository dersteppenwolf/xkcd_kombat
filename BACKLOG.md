# Prioritized Backlog

Prioritization aims to attract and retain users: first visible improvements in the opening seconds, then replay motivation, and finally depth or maintenance.

Next recommended improvement: `Training mode`, because it makes it easier to practice ranges, combos, blocking, and special without timer pressure.

Modern browser API improvements should use capability detection, keep graceful fallbacks, and avoid adding dependencies.

AI improvements should preserve the current lightweight rule-based approach unless measured behavior shows the need for a larger architecture change.

## Deferred Ideas

These ideas are intentionally not part of the active backlog until support, complexity, or measurable need improves.

| Idea | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| OffscreenCanvas and worker simulation | Adds architectural complexity that should wait for measured main-thread performance issues. |
| AudioWorklet sound generation | Useful only if the current Web Audio approach becomes too limited for procedural effects. |
| MediaSession pause integration | More valuable for continuous media than a short arcade game loop. |
| Speech Recognition commands | Experimental support and latency make it unreliable for real-time combat. |
| Periodic Background Sync notifications | Limited support and notification permissions add product friction. |
| Battery Status adaptation | Browser support is limited and privacy-sensitive. |
